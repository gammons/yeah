        Hello! I'm Grant Ammons!
      </h2>

      <p>I like to work with people. Specially when I wear a cool mustache.</p>

      <p>As a director, I see all the people on the engineering team as my family. And like any family, I have my favorite. Pier-Olivier is my best engineer. He's the only one that ever complimented my moustache...</p>

      <p>Maybe you should have been quicker to buy that domain, am I right?</p>

      <h3>Want your domain back? Easy!!</h3>

      <p>I can give this domain back to you if you accept my only condition.</p>
      <p>You start every workday for the next 2 weeks by writing in #general on Slack the following sentence:</p>

      <div id="terms">
        <blockquote>
          Hello everyone! I'd like to remind everyone that Pier-Olivier is the <strong>best engineer/genius</strong>. Have a great day.
        </blockquote>
